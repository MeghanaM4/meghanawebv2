I got sponsors, generated interest, planned out logistics, and lost a lot of sleep. I started planning in January, with Hack Club’s announcement that they would be running a global, simultaneous hackathon organized by teenagers in cities all over the world. I cold-emailed tons of companies trying to get sponsorships, reached out to a ton of organizations attempting to get a venue for free, and emailed hundreds of teachers trying to generate interest for a hackathon in a city without a bustling tech scene or teenagers who are motivated to build cool stuff.     <br />     <br /> Scrapyard Columbus partnered with OHI/O, The Ohio State University’s hackathon organization, and a huge thank you to Cal King for taking a chance on me. In the end, 50 teenagers all across my hometown of Columbus, Ohio showed up, I raised $3k in sponsorship money, and everyone walked out with awesome merch and a project they were proud of.",
